## VBA 读取文件

```vb
Sub readtxt()
    Dim s As String, i As Long
    Open "D:\root\vba\source\text01.txt" For Input As #1
    i = 1
    
    Do While Not EOF(1)
        Line Input #1, s
        Cells(i, 1) = s
        i = i + 1
    Loop
    Close #1
End Sub

```

```vb
Sub writeTxt()
    Dim i As Integer
    
    Open "D:\root\vba\source\text02.txt" For Output As #2
    '直接覆盖原有文件内容输入，没有情况下自动新建
    Print #2, Trim(Cells(3, 2))
    Print #2, Trim(Cells(4, 2))
    
    Close #2
End Sub
```

```vb
Sub readDir()
    Dim f As String, i As Long
    f = Dir("D:\root\vba\source\*.txt")
    Do While f <> ""
        Call readFromFile("D:\root\vba\source\" & f)
        f = Dir
    Loop
End Sub

Sub readFromFile(fullname As String)
    Dim ws As Worksheet, i As Long, s As String
    
    Set ws = Worksheets.Add
    ws.Name = Mid(fullname, InStrRev(fullname, "\") + 1)
    Open fullname For Input As #1
    i = 1
    
    Do While Not EOF(1)
        Line Input #1, s
        Cells(i, 1) = s
        i = i + 1
    Loop
    Close #1
End Sub
```

需要递归才能读取所有子文件

```vb
Sub readDir()
    Dim f As String, i As Long
    f = Dir("D:\root\vba\source\", vbDirectory)
    
    Do While f <> ""
        Call readFromFile("D:\root\vba\source\" & f)
        f = Dir
    Loop
End Sub
```
